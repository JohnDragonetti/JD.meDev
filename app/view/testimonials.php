                        I put what I was looking for on my Facebook profile, and John wasted no time in doing a Pippa Mann Breast Cancer replica for me. It's great and I love it! I highly recommend him if you want an A+ paint job for any of your iRacing vehicles.

                        I have been getting paint schemes on multiple racing simulators from John over the past 3 years or so and have been pleased with every single one he has done for me. The quality is equal to that of some of the big names in the graphic design business, and I would strongly recommend him to anyone.

                        John has painted a couple cars for me for iRacing when I used to race. His work is top of the line, clean, and always turn out great. He will do any request given to him and gets it done in a timely fashion. I recommend anybody who needs graphic work of any sort to use John. It's definitely some of the best work I have ever seen.

                        In my opinion John Dragonetti is a very good painter on the Iracing.com service. Over they many months that I have raced with him in leagues and official, I have always seen great quality paint schemes on not just his car, but the cars that he painted for. When I ask him to paint schemes for me for various cars he always does great work and gets it done in a timely fashion. He has done many schemes in which I race with for many months at time. To the community at large, he is both respectable on track and off.

                        John has made some of the sharpest automotive work i've seen in quite some time. His work and determination to make a deadline is what drives him to being one of the best artists i've seen in some time.

                        What you can expect from John are top notch creations every time. He will deliver his best every time in an effective way. If his best doesn't meet ones' vision he will do what it takes to meet that need, raising the quality level above what it already is. However there is never a need to fix his work. He sets out for perfection and makes sure everything is done right the first time. This is his life. This what you're going to get, a guy who knows what he is doing every time you ask. For me, John Dragonetti is always the right guy for the job.

                        I've had my paint schemes done by John Dragonetti since the NASCAR09 days, and he has done very well making them exact replica. He has been very creative on fictionals as well. His work is high quality, clean, and well presented in sim racing. I couldn't expect anything less, but the best work I have seen has come from John. In my mind, he's work is amongst the best of the best.
