# JD.me Dev build
This is the development build of the framework that powers johndragonetti.me

This project came about after John Dragonetti and Wes Hicks decided to collaborate
on something that would further their development skills. This project is intended 
to provide a light weight blogging platform, as well as a simple website management
tool. It is currently under active development, and will likely be seeing many
improvements across the board as development progresses.


## Features

* Light weight, Easy-to-use blogging platform
* Straight-forward page management system
* Includes [Twitter Bootstrap v3.3.4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) for Control 
panel styling and grid framework
* The latest [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via CDN, with a local fallback.


## Documentation

Currently no documentation exists for this project. Until the project is more 
full-featured, we have no plans to provide documentation.


## Contributing

The goal of this project is primarily to further our knowledge of the development 
process. We don't intend to have anyone else actively contribute to this project, 
but if you find any security vulnerabilities or bad programming practices, feel free 
to let us know and we'll correct them.
