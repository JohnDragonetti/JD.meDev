                First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I find it of the utmost importance that people know at least the basics of the person they are working with. That is what this is for. So here is a blurb about myself.
                <p>
                I'm a college educated 24 year old that has studied in the University of North Carolina at Charlotte's Political Science department, as well as in the International Studies department. In my time there I had the privilege to work along side some of the best researchers in the field, and even do some unique socialization related election research of my own that has been developed and taken further by the department to test its legitimacy.
                <p>
                Outside of my academic life, I developed a love for racing, and the passion to become a part of the sport in any way possible. When I saw my first race in 2002 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, I was hooked from there. For years I prodded around trying to find a way to race myself, but never had the money. Fast forward five years later, I had the opportunity to run my own league (which still exists today) in which we ran on the game NASCAR 09. It had a unique feature which racers were able to generate their own custom cars via outside programs. Seeing these (crude) recreation of cars of the time, I wanted to take it upon myself to do the same, but with more accuracy. It was from there I saw a potential way into the sport.
                <p>
                Utilizing Photoshop, I was able to do just that, and even do some designs of my own. As the years past, my skill level grew greatly from simple cars using straight lines, to now intricate designs utilizing curves, gradients, and other different effects. After a risky shift to the iRacing platform, it was here that I was able to obtain many great opportunities not only to race, but design cars for some of the service's best. I've worked with innovators of the service like Steve Luvender and Shawn Brant, creators of the widely used Trading Paints and Race Points Manager programs, as well as a couple others. My biggest break so far was having the priviledge of designing two cars for the iRacing service and NASCAR itself for their NASCAR Race of Champions at the Hall of Fame in early December 2013.
